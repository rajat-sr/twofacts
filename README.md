# TwoFacts
Two-factor authentication for Node.js using one-time password (TOTP, HOTP). Supports Google Authenticator app.

TwoFacts implements the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

### generateSecret
Generates a new, random, base32-encoded secret key that can be added to an authenticator app, like Google Authenticator, to generate OTPs.

| `otpauthurl`  |              No              |       `false`      | If `true`, this function will also generate the optauth URL which can be used to create a QR code.  |
| `label`       |Yes, if `otpauthurl` is `true`|       None         | Label that will be displayed on the authenticator app for the generated secret.                     |

#### Returns 
The following object:

If `otpauthurl` is `true`:
```js
{
  secret: 'LM7SGZFB4PBVJXXTFE2YDI22QUAHI3NK', // Base32 encoded random `string` value as the secret.
  url: 'otpauth://totp/label?secret=LM7SGZFB4PBVJXXTFE2YDI22QUAHI3NK' // OTPAUTH URL
}
```

If `otpauthurl` is `false`:
```js
{
  secret: 'LM7SGZFB4PBVJXXTFE2YDI22QUAHI3NK', // Base32 encoded random `string` value as the secret.
  url: null
}
```

| `otp`               |      Yes      |       None         | One-time password user has entered from the Google Authenticator app.|
| `secret`            |      Yes      |       None         | The secret key for the application against which OTP is generated.   |                                                                                  
| `window`            |      No       |       `1`          | The time step window for which the function should verify. For example, if the time step is 30 seconds and window is 1, then the function will verify OTPs generated at current time, 30 seconds before current time and 30 seconds after current time. If window is 2, it will check for 60 seconds before current time and 60 seconds after. |
| `timeStepInSeconds` |      No       |       `30`         | The size of window in seconds after which a new OTP is calculated.   |
| `initialTime`       |      No       |       `0`          | The starting time which should be subtracted from current time to verify OTP. Default value `0` indicates the Unix epoch time (00:00:00 January 1st, 1970 at UTC).   |
| `otpLength`         |      No       |       `6`          | The number of digits of OTP generated.                               |
